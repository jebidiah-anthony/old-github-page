<p>I am proficient in various programming and scripting languages such as C/C++, bash, Javascript, and Python. I also have fundamental knowledge on computer networks and am capable of efficiently designing Information Retrieval Systems. This skill set that Iâ€™ve developed has somehow driven me to delve into penetration testing and IT security as a field in general.</p>

<p>This website serves as an avenue for me to share various security-related topics such as CTF challenge solutions, create proof-of-concepts, and other things that have interested me.</p>
